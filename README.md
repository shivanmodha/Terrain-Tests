# Terrain-Tests
A playground repository for me to try out Unity 3D and implement a few tests. None of these projects are fully complete, and none of the are complete games; however, some of these implement conceptual algorithms are basic unity features that can be used to create awesome things!

## Development
1. Get ahold of this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivanmodha/Unity-Tests
cd Unity-Tests
```
2. Open any test in Unity.
3. Test away!

## Tests
- FPS Test
- Interior Building
- Spherical World
- VR Test

## Post Processing Stack
Unity graphics look terrible out of the box; however, there is an amazing post processing stack available through the asset store that will allow you to make wonderful looking applications and games. It is a bit graphically intensive, so expect more GPU/CPU overheat. I have not tested this out in mobile devices yet either.

Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owZneI02YOU) for a quick tutorial on how to use the post processing stack to make a visually stunning environment.
